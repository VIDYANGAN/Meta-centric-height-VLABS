<ul><li>Whenever a body, floating in a liquid is given a small angular displacement, it starts oscillating about some point, this point about which the body starts oscillating is called Meta Centre.</li>
<li>A point from which the weight of a body or system may be considered to act is known as Centre of gravity.</li>
<li>The distance between the center of gravity of a floating body and the meta centre is called meta-centric height.</li></ul><br>
As a matter of fact the meta-centric height of a floating body is a direct measure of its stability or in other words more the metacentric height of a floating body more it will be stable. A body is said to be in equilibrium when it remains in a steady state, while floating in a liquid. Following are the three conditions of equilibrium of a floating body:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1.Stable equilibrium<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2.Unstable equilibrium <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3.Neutral equilibrium <br>
<b>STABLE EQUILIBRIUM:</b> A body is said to be in a stable equilibrium if it returns back to its original position when given a small angular displacement. This happens when the meta centre is higher than the center of gravity of the floating body.<br>
<br>
<b>UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM :</b> A body is said to be in an unstable equilibrium if it does not return back to its original position and heels further away when given a small angular displacement. This happens when the meta centre is lower than the center of gravity of the floating body.<br>
 <br>
<b>NEUTRAL EQUILIBRIUM:</b> A body is said to be in a Neutral Equilibrium if it occupies a new position and remains rest in this new position when given a small angular displacement. This happens when the meta centre coincides with the centre of gravity of the floating body.<br>

 Consider a ship floating in water as shown in figure. If slight angular displacement is given to the floating body in the clockwise direction, the centre of buoyancy shifts from B to B’ such that the line of action of force of buoyancy, Fb  through B’ cuts the axis at M, which is called the meta-centre and the distance GM is called the meta-centric height. The buoyant force Fb through B’ and weight w through G constitute a couple acting in anti-clockwise direction and thus bringing the floating body in the original position.<br>
To determine the meta-centric height of a floating body, we know the centre of gravity of floating body. Place the known movable weight (w) over the centre of the body. <br>
The weight w is moved across the vessel towards right through a distance x. The body will be tilted. The angle of tilt &theta; is measured by means of plumb line and a protractor attached on the body. The new centre of gravity of the body will shift to G’ as the weight w has been moved towards the right. The centre of buoyancy will change to B’ as the body has tilted. Under equilibrium, the moment caused by the movement of the load w through a distance x must be equal to the moment caused by the shift of the centre of gravity from G to G’. Thus:<br>
		The moment due to change of G= (GG’ * W) = (W * GM tan &theta;)<br>
		The moment due to movement of w = (w * x)<br>
		Therefore,        (w * x) = W GM tan &theta;<br>
        <br>
		Hence,             GM = (w*x)/(W* tan &theta;)<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Where, <br>
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;w= applied weight.<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;W= Weight of ship=8.55kg (assumed).<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;x= distance at which weight is applied.<br>
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&theta; = angle of heel.<br>
