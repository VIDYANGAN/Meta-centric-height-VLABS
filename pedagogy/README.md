#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment.

<u> <b>Description: </b>  </u>
<br>
 Firstly the students will be explained off with each and every basics about the meta center, buoyancy, force of buoyancy, meta-centric height, equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, and the experiment. Then they will be explained about the procedure of the experiment, how to perform it. Then they will be asked to perform the experiment and find the value for angle of tilt for different values of applied weight and distance moved by the weight. After observing the values for angle of tilt they are supposed to calculate the meta-centric height using stated formula and verify their answers with pre-examined values or assumed standard values.

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Observe the complete experimental setup and know the initial conditions for the experiment. Check the drain valve for it to be closed. | Show the complete experimental setup. | To make the user well aware with the experimental setup and apparatus used and to recall the concepts of meeta-centric height.
2.| Click on the water inlet valve being highlighted to fill the tank with water. | Fill the water tank with liquid (water).  | To fill the tank with liquid (water) so that the experiment may begin.
3.| Click on the variable weight to apply the weight and then click on the NEXT button.| Apply the variable weight on the ship model and open the next slide of the ship model. | To apply the weight on the ship model to observe the angle of tilt.
4.| Choose the values for applied weight and distance at which applied in the table. | Take the input from the user for weight and distance.  | To take input values from the user.
5.| Observe the angle of tilt displayed by the simulator and then click on the NEXT button. | Display the angle of tilt in the table and open the next slide.| To provide the value of angle of heel for the applied weight  and distance.
6.| Calculate the meta-centric height of the ship model using the observed and predefined values.  | Calculate the metacentric height of the ship using the values provided and save the value to let the user check their values. | To calculate the meta-centric height of the ship model and let the user calculate it by their own using values provided and later verify both.
