<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Fluids are a key element of study for many engineering disciplines. Fluid Mechanics is of vital importance in energy conversion systems (hydro power, gas turbines, combustion etc.), in process industry (paper, metals, polymers etc.) and for transports (airplanes, ships etc.). The Fluid Mechanics laboratory is actively engaged to reinforce and enhance understanding of the fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics. The experiments here are designed to demonstrate the applications of the basic fluid engineering principles and to provide a more intuitive and physical understanding of the theory. The all experimental set-ups are designed and developed by the institute according to the Indian standards. The Fluid Mechanics lab is equipped with different flow measuring set-ups such as venturi meter, orifice meter, nozzle, centrifugal head meter, where students can visualize the basic theory of working of the flow meter. 

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

 To determine the meta-centric height of a given ship model.Meta-centric height is a parameter to measure the static stability of a floating body, as it is defined as a distance  between the center of gravity of a body and its meta-center. It has a direct relationship with the stability of the body. So, larger the meta-centric height more is the stability.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

Students pursuing their B.tech or M.tech degree in civil or mechanical engineering discipline.

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

   B.tech civil Engineering

<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>

   Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow
